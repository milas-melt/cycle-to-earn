# cycle-to-earn
Would be cool to create the hardware and software for a new concept: cycle to earn.

The circuit would look a bit like below
![electrical circuit for the bike battery charger](https://github.com/milas-melt/cycle-to-earn/blob/main/bike-battery-charger-circuit-diagram-2.jpeg?raw=true)

I'll check what softwares are available for simulation and optimisation in my uni. Will take care of the blockchain part later. Of course, the money generated won't be worth the time spent biking i.e. this project is not profitable, but it's fun so f*ck it.
